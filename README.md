# Traveller Combat VTT

A web-based Virtual Tabletop (VTT) for **Mongoose Traveller 2nd Edition** space combat, built with TDD principles.

**Status:** ✅ **Stage 12.5 Complete - Ship Templates & Validation Infrastructure**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests (161 tests, 100% passing across 16 suites)
npm test

# View ship templates (static viewer)
open public/ship-templates.html
# Or: python3 -m http.server 8000, then http://localhost:8000/public/ship-templates.html

# Start server for multiplayer mode (Stages 8-9 combat)
npm start
# Then open http://localhost:3000 in TWO browser tabs
```

---

## 🎮 How to Play

### Multiplayer Mode (Default - Two Browser Tabs)

**This is the ONLY working mode. There is NO single-player mode.**

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open TWO browser tabs:**
   - Tab 1: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Tab 2: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (in a new tab or window)

3. **You'll see clear player indicators:**
   - Top of screen shows: **"Player 1"** or **"Player 2"**
   - Shows which ship you're assigned: **Scout** or **Free Trader**

4. **Select ships:**
   - Each tab (player) selects their spacecraft
   - Choose starting range
   - Click **"Ready"** when done

5. **Combat begins:**
   - Turn-based combat starts automatically when both players are ready
   - UI clearly indicates whose turn it is
   - Switch between browser tabs to play both sides

### Playing Against Yourself
The easiest way to test the game is to:
1. Open Tab 1 → Select Scout → Click Ready
2. Open Tab 2 → Select Free Trader → Click Ready
3. Switch between tabs to take turns for each player

**Important:** Each browser tab represents one player. You control ONLY the ship assigned to that tab.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Real-time:** Socket.io (WebSockets)
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS
- **Testing:** Custom Node.js test runner (Jest-style)
- **Data:** In-memory (persistence planned for Stage 13+)

### Design Principles
- **TDD-First:** Tests before implementation (1.78:1 test-to-code ratio)
- **Server-Authoritative:** Server validates all combat actions
- **Event-Driven:** All actions via Socket.io events
- **Modular:** Clean separation of concerns
- **British Spelling:** Matches Traveller rules ("armour", not "armor")

### Key Technical Decisions
- Turn-based sequential combat (enforced server-side)
- Combat state tracked in Map (scalable to Redis/PostgreSQL)
- Client-side prediction for UI responsiveness
- Integration tests validate end-to-end flows
- Zero technical debt maintained across all stages
