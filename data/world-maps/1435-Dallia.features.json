  "arrivalBriefing": "Dallia fills the viewport like a proper world should — blue-white atmosphere haze, visible continents, cloud formations that suggest weather rather than chemical processes. The dense atmosphere scatters the F2 primary's light into a warm glow.\n\nThe Class B starport is immediately obvious: a proper industrial facility with multiple docking arms, fuel processing towers, and the steady traffic of commercial shipping. This is civilization — the first real city the crew has seen since leaving the Imperium proper.\n\nDescent through the dense atmosphere is smooth. The starport grounds are clean, well-maintained, and staffed by people who look healthy, fed, and unhurried. After Milagro and Forine, it feels like arriving in a different century.",
