The Class B orbital station is the first thing you see — a bright structure against the dark, bristling with docking arms and the silhouettes of naval vessels.\n\nBelow, the surface is frozen and wind-scoured, dotted with sealed settlements connected by surface transit tubes. The atmospheric taint is invisible but ever-present — filter masks are mandatory outside sealed structures.",
