Upper levels feature filtered-air gardens and luxury residences. McClellan Factors and Tukera Lines have their corridor headquarters in adjacent towers.",
      "campaignNotes": "Senator Adama Koss (pro-Imperial faction leader) operates from Assembly Hall. Reva Teng (Vemene/Tukera) in Tukera Tower. Kellan Marsh (McClellan) in McClellan Tower. Political endgame plays out here."

The criminal ecosystem here is older than the Drakon Syndicate — they operate within it but don't control it. Minimal policing, syndicate safe houses scattered throughout.",

Moderate crime, police patrols, functional public services. Where most of Collace's 4 billion live their daily lives. Anti-Imperial media broadcasts are common here — the Syndicate's information warfare targets this demographic.",

Subsurface mineral extraction provides raw materials for industry. Ocean thermal vents power some arcology clusters.",
      "campaignNotes": "Limits dry land severely — forces the arcology lifestyle. The ocean is why 4 billion people live in building-cities instead of spreading out."

  "arrivalBriefing": "Collace resolves on sensors as a blue-gray marble wrapped in cloud bands, orbiting close to the white-hot primary Gorie with its red companion Sonor visible as a distant ember. At 9,600 kilometers it's a proper world — and at first glance, a wet one. Eighty percent ocean, the surface is an endless expanse of dark water broken by scattered archipelagos of rocky land.\n\nThe arcologies are visible from orbit — massive structures rising from the islands like geometric mountains, their upper levels catching Gorie's harsh light. Filter domes cap the tallest towers. Between the arcology clusters, the tainted thin atmosphere is a hazy blue shimmer that you'd barely notice if you didn't know it would kill you in minutes without a respirator.\n\nCollace Highport is a different world from the frontier ports of D268. B-class — clean docking bays, refined fuel, automated cargo handling, commercial brokerage services. Ships from across the Spinward Main dock here. This is the wealthiest, most advanced world in District 268, and the highport shows it.",
