  "arrivalBriefing": "Noctocol resolves as a world wrapped in sickly orange-yellow haze. The corrosive atmosphere is visible even from orbit — a toxic blanket that obscures the surface. Occasional breaks reveal the fluid oceans: shimmering, iridescent, and utterly lethal to unprotected materials.\n\nThe downport beacon guides you through the haze to a sealed landing pad. Even through the ship's hull, the atmospheric analysis reads like a chemistry textbook of things that dissolve metal.",
