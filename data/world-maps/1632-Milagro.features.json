The world's five domes appear as pale blisters on the nightside — clusters of light in an ocean of frozen nothing.\n\nDescent reveals the scale of desolation: regolith plains stretching to every horizon, exposed bedrock ridges, and the dull gleam of the Brine Basin's frozen surface. The atmosphere is essentially vacuum — trace gases that wouldn't sustain a candle flame.\n\nMilagro Downport is a cracked ferrocrete pad surrounded by prefab structures. The customs shack looms larger than the landing facilities. Even before the ramp lowers, the crew can see the inspectors lining up — clipboards, scanners, and the weary patience of professionals who have all day and nothing better to do.",
