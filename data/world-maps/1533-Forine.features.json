      "description": "Poor-quality surface starport on cracked ferrocrete. Chronically overwhelmed by traffic from 6 billion in-system. Unrefined fuel only, no shipyard, minimal repair. Would be Class A if not sabotaged — the 1104 construction strike destroyed facilities and every repair attempt since has been quietly undermined by oligarch interests.",

The trace atmosphere is invisible — this is effectively a vacuum world.\n\nAs the ship approaches, the nightside tells the real story: thousands of dome lights scattered across the surface like bioluminescent organisms on a deep-sea floor. Six billion souls live in this system — 1.6 billion on the surface in those domes, 3 billion in the Dragan Belt, the rest in trojan clusters. The domes are so densely distributed that from orbit the nightside gives the illusion of a single world-spanning structure.\n\nForine Downport is a disaster. Class D — cracked ferrocrete, minimal nav beacons, queue times measured in hours. The 1104 construction strike destroyed the facilities and nobody with power wants them fixed. Armed customs officers (Law Level 8) await with scanners and patience.",
