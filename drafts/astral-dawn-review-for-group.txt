ISS ASTRAL DAWN — DESIGN REVIEW
Ship Design: James  |  Rules Review: Bruce (GM)
Mongoose Traveller 2e, High Guard (2022 Update)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT CHANGED AND WHY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

James's original design builds a TANK — heavy armor, dedicated point
defense, built to absorb punishment through a long engagement.

The review shifts toward AMBUSH PREDATOR — look harmless, strike
devastatingly, end fights fast. This is the Q-ship doctrine: the ship
that never gets identified as a warship wins more fights than the ship
that survives 10 rounds of incoming fire.

Here's the tradeoff at a glance:

  DEFENSE LOST                      OFFENSE GAINED
  ────────────────────────────────  ────────────────────────────────
  Armor 14 → 1 (-13 protection)    Ion: Medium → Long range
  Weapon Bay PD removed (-20t)      Ion: HY damage boost (~5%)
                                    Particle: AP+2 (Intense Focus)
                                    Particle: HY damage boost (~5%)
                                    Particle: avg Severity 5 crits

  COVER IMPROVED                    SPACE FREED
  ────────────────────────────────  ────────────────────────────────
  Armor invisible to sensors        ~65 tons net freed
  2 visible turrets = normal liner  Available for cargo, fuel,
  4 passenger cabins = believable   or resolving tonnage overrun
  Ship passes port inspection

WHY LESS ARMOR IS MORE SHIP:

James's armor solved for "survive a long engagement." But with Marina
at Gunner-6 and FC/4, that's the wrong problem. Her first ion shot
drains ~43% of a pirate's power for D3 rounds. Her second shot
(particle barbette) averages 50+ hull damage with a Severity 5
critical — that's a random system destroyed or crippled. Fight
effectively over in 2 rounds. We don't need to absorb 10 rounds of
incoming because there won't BE 10 rounds of incoming.

And we have a fighter screen. Six fighters at extreme range plus an
armed launch are already massive force projection for a 600t ship.
The fighters handle standoff work. Marina handles precision kills.
The turrets provide PD and missile volleys under AI control. Armor 14
was belt-and-suspenders on a ship that already has a belt, suspenders,
and a pair of overalls.

Meanwhile, Armor 14 was actively HURTING us. Every port approach,
every passive sensor sweep, every customs inspection — the hull
density screams "warship." The Q-ship mission depends on ships
APPROACHING us. Pirates don't approach warships. They approach
battered liners. Armor 1 is what a battered liner has.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT JAMES GOT RIGHT (a lot)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  • Pop-up turrets: correct Q-ship feature
  • Pulse lasers + sandcasters + adv missiles: excellent layered defense
  • Ion + Particle barbettes: exactly the right heavy weapons for the
    mission (disable then kill)
  • Computer/25 with FC/4: top-tier military software, undetectable
    from outside the ship
  • Emission Absorption Grid: essential for the mission
  • Boarding suite (breech tube + forced linkage + clamps): comprehensive
    prize-taking capability
  • Crew assignments and backup roles: very thoughtful
  • Collapsible tanks + jump net: massive operational range
  • All four hull coatings: solid defensive package

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
A. CHANGES NEEDED (5 items)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A1. ARMOR: 14 → 1
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Was:  Armor 14 Bonded Superdense (67.2t, MCr33.6M)
  Now:  Armor 1 (standard for this hull class)

The Amishi had Armor 1 when we salvaged her. That's standard for a
600t liner of this type. Changing it to anything higher would itself
be visible — any yard that touched her hull would notice the upgrade.
More importantly, Armor 14 is capital-ship grade. Even passive sensors
detect hull density anomalies at that level.

This is the one item I'm firm on. Everything else is negotiable.

Frees: ~61 tons.

A2. WEAPON BAY PD: Remove
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Was:  20t Weapon Bay Point Defense (Rating 1)
  Now:  Removed

600t hull = 6 hardpoints. We're using all 6 (4 turrets + 2 barbettes).
The weapon bay PD would need a 7th hardpoint that doesn't exist. Our
6 sandcasters already provide excellent PD coverage.

Frees: 20 tons.

A3. TURRET VISIBILITY: 2 Visible, 2 Hidden
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Turrets 1-2 (VISIBLE):     Pulse laser + 2× sandcaster each
  Turrets 3-4 (HIDDEN POP-UP): Pulse laser + sandcaster + adv missile

A standard Type-R 600t liner shows 2 defensive turrets. Having exactly
2 visible maintains cover perfectly. The strike turrets (with advanced
missiles) stay hidden until combat.

A4. PASSENGER CABINS: Add 4
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Was:  Zero passenger staterooms
  Now:  4 passenger staterooms (~16t)

A "subsidized liner" that can't carry a single passenger fails basic
port inspection. These 4 cabins create a Potemkin village — a small
section of the ship that looks like a working liner. When we don't
have actual passengers (almost always), crew expands into them. Key
is having a civilian-face area to bring visitors aboard that does NOT
look like a naval vessel.

Costs: ~16 tons.

A5. TONNAGE BUDGET: Needs Clean Pass
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The spreadsheet's "Remaining" shows 30,006.9999 — formula error.
Several other formula issues:
  • Low berths: shows -600% instead of -6t
  • Probe drones: shows -100% instead of -5t
  • Hull HP: shows 600 instead of 240 (should be tonnage × 0.4)
  • Fighter hangar for 6×10t fighters (~66t) has no line item

The ~65t freed from armor + PD removal helps absorb any overrun, but
the full tonnage budget needs a clean recalculation. James, when you
get a chance, a pass through the formulas (especially anything showing
percentages) would be great.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
B. BARBETTE UPGRADES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Marina has +10 DM before range (Gunner-6 + FC/4). Sensor operator
can grant a Boon (3D keep best 2) via Sensor Lock — separate action.
She auto-hits at every range up to Very Long. At Distant she only
misses on snake-eyes.

The upgrade system uses High Guard's Prototype/Advanced table:
building a weapon at +3 TL above base = "High Technology" = 3
Advantages, at +50% base cost. Both barbettes qualify (TL12/11
base, built at TL15 = +3 TL).

ION CANNON BARBETTE — High Yield + Long Range
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Was:  TL12 standard. Medium range, 7D×3 Ion.         MCr 6
  Now:  TL15 High Technology. Long range, 7D×3 (HY).   MCr 9

  • High Yield: 1's on damage dice count as 2's (~5% more damage)
  • Long Range: Medium → Long (start disabling one band sooner)
  • Result: One hit drains ~85-90 Power from target (×3 barbette
    multiplier). Against a 200t pirate (~200 Power), that's ~43%
    of their power plant knocked out for 1 round (D3 if Effect 6+).

  The ion cannon's job is DISABLE. Long Range is the star here —
  starting the power drain at Long instead of Medium is huge.
  HY adds a modest damage bonus on top.

PARTICLE CANNON BARBETTE — High Yield + Intense Focus
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Was:  TL11 standard. Very Long, 4D×3 + Radiation.    MCr 8
  Now:  TL15 High Technology. Very Long, 4D×3 (HY, AP2). MCr 12

  • High Yield: 1's on damage dice count as 2's
  • Intense Focus: AP+2 (cuts through 2 points of armour)
  • Result: Against Armour 4 pirates, avg 50 hull damage + random
    critical at Severity 5. Against Armour 8+ ships, AP+2 pushes
    damage across a Severity threshold.

  The particle cannon's job is KILL. AP+2 matters because barbettes
  multiply damage ×3 after armour — every point of armour you negate
  becomes 3 points of final damage. Against even lightly armoured
  targets, Intense Focus outperforms Accurate.

  ALTERNATIVE: Accurate(2) + HY(1) if we want better critical trigger
  chance at Very Long range (41.7% → 58.3%). Worth discussing.

TL NOTE: +3 TL above base = 3 Advantages per High Guard's
Prototype/Advanced table (p70). Costs +50% of base price. Legal
at any TL15 shipyard. JSI has TL15 access.

C. CREW RECONCILIATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

MARINES: 8 (not 6)
  PDF shows 6, crew roster has 8. Going with 8:
  Asao, Sgt. Reyes, Cpl. Henriksen, Cpl. Woo-Park,
  Kowalski, Mbeki, O'Brien, Chen.
  NCOs in staterooms 2/18-2/20. Enlisted in barracks.
  Current 12 barracks bunks works (6 pilots + 4 enlisted + 2 spare).

LEAD FIGHTER PILOT: Lt. Dex Morain (not Roger Wilcox)
  Per established crew roster. Callsign "Hardpoint."
  James, if Wilcox is a separate character you had in mind, let me know.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
D. UNCHANGED (All Approved)

  Additional cost for barbette mods: +MCr 7
  (Ion: MCr6 → MCr9, Particle: MCr8 → MCr12)
  (Ion: +MCr4.5, Particle: +MCr8)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
F. OPEN ITEMS (need James to verify in spreadsheet)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  1. Fix percentage formulas (low berths, probe drones, etc.)
  2. Add explicit fighter hangar line item (~66t)
  3. Verify internal fuel = J-3 requirement + 4 weeks power plant
     (should be ~200t; sheet shows 242.4t — where's the extra 42t?)
  4. Verify power budget with weapons firing (120 basic + M-drive +
     weapons + sensors = total demand vs plant output)
  5. Recalculate total tonnage with above changes

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

James — armor is my one hard line (cover story depends on it).
Everything else here is a proposal and I'm happy to discuss any of
it. The barbette upgrades in particular were a fun exercise in
optimization — Marina's combat math is ridiculous.

Happy to walk through any of this on the call.
— Bruce
