PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Milagro is a small, frozen world orbiting a dim red dwarf. The trace
atmosphere is essentially vacuum. The landscape is cratered ice sheets,
regolith dunes, and exposed bedrock. The sky is black with a sullen red
sun that never quite feels like daylight.

Gravity is 0.26G. Long-term residents have adapted: taller, thinner
frames, deliberate movements. Newcomers bounce and stumble.

THE DOMES
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Five major domed cities house the population. All were built by Forine
during the penal colony era (TL-9+ construction, 750s–1079). Milagro's
TL-7 population maintains them below their build level:

  • Failing pressure seals — patched with scavenged polymer and prayer
  • Rolling blackouts — power grid at 70% on good days
  • Recycler breakdowns — when the CHONP processors fail, the smell
    is indescribable
  • Cracked transparencies — some dome sections permanently sealed off

  Dome            Pop     Founded   Character
  ─────────────── ─────── ───────── ──────────────────────────────────────
  Exile's Rest    ~12M    756       Oldest. Voiceless Song echoes in corridors.
  Haven           ~35M    993       Largest. Government center. Food distribution HQ.
  Crystalline     ~8M     810       Elite dome. Better-maintained, imported fixtures.
  Last Light      ~15M    1082      Newest. Tightest community, deepest distrust.
  Downport Dome   ~20M    780       Starport. Most diverse. Crystal Houses district.

STARPORT (CLASS E)
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Cracked ferrocrete landing pad. One nav beacon. Prefab customs shack.
No refined fuel. The bureaucratic apparatus is immense — more customs
officers than landing pads.

  ⚠ NO EXTRALITY ZONE: Unlike normal starports, Milagro's port falls
  under dome law (prison-era legal framework). Even refueling requires
  customs processing. This is why advocates exist here.

SOCIAL GROUPS
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Milagro's population descends from waves of Forinean deportees. Each
wave carries distinct identity:

OLD TRANSPORTEES (750s–990) — Political prisoners, dissidents. Iron
pride, bitter Forine hatred. Territory: Exile's Rest. Recognizable by
geometric tattoo patterns on forearms. The Closed-Fist Greeting
originated here. Maintain oral histories of every deportation ship.

RESETTLEMENT WAVE (992–1079) — Largest group. Civilians herded aboard
ships at gunpoint. Pragmatic, communal, quietly furious. Territory:
Haven. Recognizable by synthi-bread sharing rituals. Deeply suspicious
of anyone connected to Forine.

ELITE EXILES — Fallen oligarchs. Brought Forinean high-culture
attitudes: education, hierarchy, refinement. Territory: Crystalline.
Recognizable by formal speech, quality clothing. Still claim Forinean
property rights.

POST-COLLAPSE (post-1079) — Survivors of the 4.3 million deaths when
Forine abandoned Milagro. Trust nothing and no one. Territory: Last
Light. Tight groups, shared food caches. Children taught escape routes
before they learn to read.

CULTURAL NOTES
═══════════════════════════════════════════

  • Closed-Fist Greeting: "I hold nothing against you." Centuries old,
    from Forinean dome-workers.

  • Voiceless Song: Wordless hum in corridors. Started as grief, now
    identity.

  • Crystal Houses: High-end entertainment district. Cultural pride,
    not stigma. Founded by earliest deportees.

  • Scratch Art: Geometric patterns carved into every surface.
    "I was here. I existed."

  • Synthi-bread Sharing: Communal meal ritual. "We share because we
    survived starvation together."

  • Ancestor Dome-Naming: Introduce with dome of origin + ship name:
    "Delia Cade, Haven, daughter of the Bitter Morning."
