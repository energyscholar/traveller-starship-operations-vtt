# The Story So Far

*Personal log of Wellen Stova, Medical Officer, ISS Astral Dawn*

---

You want to know what you're signing onto? Fair enough. Pull up a chair. Mr. Breck, get them something hot — no, not the fish tacos, the good stuff.

I'll start at the beginning. Or at least, the beginning I was there for.

This crew was stranded on Raschev — a water world, ten million people, tech level six — waiting on repair parts for their ship when the Chamax arrived. Not a natural infestation. The bugs came in a *spaceship*. Alien insectoids, razor-mandibles, breeding fast, swarming across the archipelago. The Navy's answer was simple: sterilize the planet from orbit. Bombard it. Write off ten million people as acceptable losses on a backwater world nobody important cared about.

This crew said no. They went down to the surface and burned the hive out themselves. Saved the planet. Saved every soul on it. You've probably seen the teledrama — they made a 3D holovid about it, "Heroes of Raschev." Statues in the town square, shrines, the whole production. The crew doesn't watch it. I've noticed that.

What nobody talks about is the cost. Decisions were made in the heat of it that sit heavy on certain shoulders. I'm a doctor — I see it in the way some of them sleep, or don't. There's an Imperial audit coming in a few months, and I've noticed the Captain gets quiet whenever anyone mentions Raschev. I don't ask. Some things, you let people tell you when they're ready.

After Raschev came Garoo. That's where I'm from — a vacuum world under the boot of dictator Ryoc IV, where the "Health Police" enforce order and a medical AI called the Medcomputer decides who gets treatment and who doesn't. This crew got framed for assassinating the dictator. They had nothing to do with it. Asao's face is still on wanted posters across two subsectors. We only escaped because Captain Delleron has connections in the Darrian Navy — deep connections, the kind that make an entire diplomatic corps move on short notice. So if you're wondering why we don't talk much about Garoo, that's why. We're wanted for something we didn't do.

Think about that for a moment. Celebrated as heroes for what happened on Raschev. Wanted as assassins for what happened on Garoo. Neither story is quite what it seems.

Now we're on a new mission. Officially, we're the ISS Astral Dawn, a subsidized liner running cargo along the Caladbolg-Collace corridor. Food processors, passenger berths, the usual dull freight. That's the story for anyone who asks.

The truth is we're a Q-Ship — a warship in merchant's clothing. Six concealed fighter bays behind false cargo panels. Pop-up turrets with a particle accelerator that Marina can thread through a needle at combat range. An ion barbette for disabling ships we want to take intact. A full marine squad under Asao that could breach a hardened station. We're hunting a Vargr pirate pack called Blood Profit, and we're using ourselves as bait.

The Joint Security Initiative set it up. We departed Flammarion, picked up supplies at Faldor, then seeded criminal rumors at Caladbolg — staged a very public exchange with a JSI asset at the X-boat terminus so the dock workers and info brokers would spread the word. Did some actual dirty work at Datrillian to make the cover stick — a real favor for a real smuggler named Mira Koss, not theater this time. Delivered weapons to dissidents on Elixabeth who've been under Forine's thumb since the 990 suppression. Each jump, the line between the cover story and who we're actually becoming gets a little harder to see.

It's working. A scout ship with no transponder watched us arrive at Elixabeth, sent an encrypted burst, and jumped away. The pirates know we're here. They're out there right now, deciding when and where to hit us.

While we were on Elixabeth, Marina ran an intelligence operation at the Cold Comfort bar. Linked up with a survivor from the last ship the Blood Profit Pack took — a haunted man named Harlan Cade. Poor bastard doesn't know the pirates put a subdermal tracker under his skin before they let him go. Everywhere he goes, they know. Marina and the Captain are aware of the tracker — they're using it, feeding the pirates exactly what we want them to see. Cade's back on Elixabeth now, none the wiser. It's the kind of thing that keeps me up at night, but I understand the math.

Max — our engineer, the one who talks to his machines and performs experimental surgery on paying passengers — he's sitting on something. Collected biological samples from natives on Faldor, and his droid Eddie says the compounds are natural anti-aging agents worth a fortune. Legal, sustainable, immensely valuable. The irony is we're carrying *illegal* anagathics as pirate bait while Max has the legal version in his rucksack.

Von Sydo runs sensors. Quiet. Intense. Good at his work in a way that makes you wonder where he learned it. He and his wife Vera keep to themselves mostly — she assists me in medical when needed, and she's competent, but they have their own rhythms. He spends a lot of time at the sensor console even off-duty, watching the dark between the stars. Given what's hunting us, I don't blame him.

The pilots are solid — six of them, callsigns Hardpoint, Whisper, Brick, Ghost, Preacher, and Dice. They run drills in the fighter bays and play cards in the common area and try not to think about the fact that their cockpits are hidden behind panels labeled "CARGO — AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT." The marines sharpen their edges. Jeri Tallux runs the computer systems with a quiet ferocity — she earned her spot by manning a destroyed turret in vacuum during a pirate attack and scoring a hit. Anemone, our youngest, is eighteen and learning fast under Marina. She sends most of her pay home to her family on Raschev. She talks to the gun turrets like they're pets.

We're bound for Milagro next, then deeper into the corridor toward Forine — six billion people, a deliberately broken starport, and the corporate interests that we suspect are feeding these pirates their targets. After that, if we're still flying, the real fight.

So that's what you're joining. A crew of people wanted for crimes they didn't commit, celebrated for things that haunt them, disguised as merchants, hunting pirates who are hunting us back. The coffee is adequate. Mr. Breck's surf-and-turf is genuinely excellent — he was a restaurant chef before Marina rescued him from a taco stand, and he has opinions about cuisine that he will share whether or not you ask. The AI gunners are polite and slightly unsettling. Gamma speaks for the group and has a hesitation quirk nobody talks about.

If you can hold your post when the turret covers retract and six fighters scream out of bays that weren't there thirty seconds ago — you'll fit in fine.

Welcome aboard the Astral Dawn. Try not to die.

# Appendix A: New Player Orientation Brief

*GM Reference — Bruce Stephenson*

This appendix provides technical and background details for a new player joining the Tuesday Spinward Marches campaign. Read the narrative above first for tone and story; use this section for the facts.

## Executive Summary

You are crew aboard the **ISS Astral Dawn**, a 600-ton Q-Ship (warship disguised as a merchant liner) operating under a Letter of Marque from the **Joint Security Initiative (JSI)**. Your mission is to pose as a vulnerable cargo hauler on the Caladbolg-Collace corridor in **District 268**, attracting and destroying the **Blood Profit Pack** — a Vargr pirate group that has been terrorizing independent shipping.

District 268 is a non-Imperial subsector in the Spinward Marches. It cannot be admitted to the Third Imperium until piracy and instability are brought under control — a process expected to take 50-100 years. The JSI is the multi-system security organization working toward that goal. Your captain, James Delleron, has deep ties to this effort.

The crew has a complicated recent history: they are **celebrated heroes on Raschev** (for defeating an alien infestation and saving ten million lives) and **wanted fugitives from Garoo** (falsely accused of assassinating a dictator). The bait operation is well underway — the pirates have spotted the Astral Dawn and are tracking its movements. A major engagement is coming.

The campaign runs on **Mongoose Traveller 2nd Edition** rules, played on **Roll20** with voice on **Discord**. Tone is character-driven, morally complex, and consequential — not grimdark, but choices matter and the universe doesn't forget.

## Flight Path: Flammarion Outbound

```
 #  System          Hex     Jump  Key Events
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 1  Flammarion      0930     —    Boarded Q-Ship. Shakedown cruise.
                                  Visited JSI Asteroid Base.
 2  Faldor          1131    J-2   Max collected Otarri bio-samples.
 3  Caladbolg       1329    J-2   Planted pirate bait at X-boat terminus.
                                  Black market anagathics purchased.
 4  Datrillian      1331    J-1   Real criminal favor for smuggler Mira Koss.
 5  Elixabeth       1532    J-2   Scout ship spotted us (encrypted burst).
                                  Harlan Cade contact. Weapons to dissidents.
 6  Milagro          —      J-?   NEXT. Food processor delivery.
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Planned: → Forine corridor → Tarkine → Mertactor → Collace (1237)
```

The ship deliberately travels at J-1 or J-2 speeds (despite J-3 capability) so rumors of valuable cargo spread ahead at Jump-1 speed. This is the "broken wing" strategy — appear slow, vulnerable, and worth hitting.

## The JSI and District 268

### Joint Security Initiative (JSI)

The JSI is District 268's multi-system security organization. It operates out of an **asteroid base near Flammarion** — an old, obsolete facility donated by a noble family as a tax write-off, now repurposed as an operations hub. The JSI also maintains a presence at **Caladbolg** (1329), which has a Scout Base and X-boat station connecting it to the Imperial communications network.

The ISS Astral Dawn operates under a **JSI Letter of Marque** — legal authorization to engage and capture pirate vessels. Mission communications go through **Commander Adele Reyes** (JSI handler, encrypted comms only). Field assets include "Scarface" Tomas (Caladbolg) and an operative codenamed "Switchback" (Elixabeth).

### District 268: The Big Picture

District 268 is a **non-Imperial subsector** of the Spinward Marches. Its worlds are independent, loosely affiliated, and largely self-governing. The Third Imperium has strategic interest in eventually incorporating District 268, but **admission requires stability** — functioning trade routes, suppressed piracy, reliable governance. At current trajectories, integration is **50-100 years away**.

Piracy is the immediate obstacle. The Blood Profit Pack is one of several groups exploiting the security vacuum. Worse, there are indications that piracy is being sustained by **corporate interests on Forine** — oligarchs who profit from the instability through inflated shipping insurance rates, elimination of independent competition, and political leverage over captive client states like Elixabeth.

Key political dynamics:
- **Forine** (1533): 6 billion population, TL9, deliberately keeps its own starport at D-class to control trade. Home to the suspected pirate-backing syndicate.
- **Elixabeth** (1532): Imperial client state, 20,000 pop, ruled from Forine since the 990 intervention. Resentful population. An Imperial Navy cruiser (*INS Duchess Delphine*) enforces peace.
- **Caladbolg** (1329): Full Imperial member, Scout Base, X-boat link — the Imperium's communications toehold in the subsector.
- **Flammarion** (0930): Full Imperial member, B-class starport, JSI operations base.

Reducing piracy in the corridor is a prerequisite for everything else. That's why the Q-Ship mission matters.

## The Raschev Story (What Really Happened)

The crew was **stranded on Raschev** (a TL6 water world, pop. 10 million) waiting for repair parts for their ship when an **alien vessel arrived** carrying **Chamax** — insectoid xenoforms that breed rapidly and swarm. The infestation spread across the archipelago. The Imperial Navy's proposed solution was **orbital bombardment** — sterilize the planet, write off ten million lives.

The crew refused to evacuate. They went to the surface, located the hive, and destroyed it. They saved the planet and every person on it.

Raschev made them famous. There's a **3D holovid teledrama** ("Heroes of Raschev"), statues in the town square, hero-worship shrines. The crew has a compound under construction on Raschev (50+ capacity) with loyal allies Eric and Signe (Aslan warriors) in residence.

The fame is a double-edged sword — it makes them visible, recognizable, and politically useful to people who want to claim association with heroes.
