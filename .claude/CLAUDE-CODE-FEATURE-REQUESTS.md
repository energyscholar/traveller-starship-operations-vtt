# Claude Code Feature Requests

## 1. File Upload Progress Indicator

**Issue:** When uploading files (images, PDFs, etc.) to Claude Code, there is no visual feedback indicating:
- Upload in progress
- Upload complete
- Upload failed
- File size/name being uploaded

**User Impact:** Users don't know if their upload is working, leading to:
- Repeated upload attempts
- Uncertainty about whether files arrived
- Wasted time waiting for uploads that may have failed

**Suggested Solution:**
Add a progress indicator showing:
```
Uploading: high-guard-page-14.png ############ 45% (2.3 MB / 5.1 MB)
```

**Priority:** High - This is a basic UX expectation for file uploads
